n = 5;               %% try to remove ";" and then see the consequence
a = rand(n,1);       %% to general n random values in (0, 1)
x = sort(a);         %% to order the above n values

%% now, you have vectors a and b. each has n components

%% to construct a vector of (n+2) x values including the end points
%% to calculate all mesh steps (they are nonuniform in general)


%% to calculate vector of y = sin(pi * x) 
%% pi = 3.14159... the value is given by Matlab
for k = 1:n
